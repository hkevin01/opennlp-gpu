# Test Output Directory

This directory contains the output logs and results of the comprehensive test runs for the OpenNLP GPU acceleration project.

## Purpose

The `test-output` directory is used to store:
- Detailed logs of test executions
- Results of comprehensive test runs
- Diagnostic information for failed tests

## Key Files

- **`comprehensive_test_results.log`**: The main log file generated by the `run_comprehensive_tests.sh` script. It contains:
  - Test execution summaries
  - Detailed results for each test
  - Configuration coverage information
  - Recommendations for resolving failures
  - **Note**: This file is overwritten on each test run for fresh results

## Usage

### Viewing Test Results
To view the results of the latest comprehensive test run:
```bash
cat test-output/comprehensive_test_results.log
```

### Analyzing Failures
If tests fail, review the log file for detailed error messages and stack traces:
```bash
less test-output/comprehensive_test_results.log
```

### Fresh Test Runs
Each time you run the comprehensive test script, the log file is completely rewritten:
```bash
./scripts/testing/run_comprehensive_tests.sh
# Creates a fresh comprehensive_test_results.log with current timestamp
```

### Cleaning Up
To clear old test results:
```bash
rm -rf test-output/*
```

## Integration with Testing Scripts

The `run_comprehensive_tests.sh` script automatically:
- Creates this directory if it doesn't exist
- Overwrites the log file on each run for fresh results
- Includes timestamps to track when tests were executed
- Provides viewing instructions in the test output

## Notes

- Always review the test results here before proceeding with deployment or further development
- The log file is overwritten each run to prevent accumulation of old results
- If you need to preserve a specific test run, copy the log file before running tests again
- Share the log file with the development team for debugging issues
