# Contributing OpenNLP GPU Acceleration to Apache OpenNLP

## Overview
This document outlines the proper protocol for contributing GPU acceleration features to the Apache OpenNLP project.

## Current Project Status
- **Current Repository**: Standalone OpenNLP GPU acceleration extension
- **Target**: Contribute to Apache OpenNLP official repository
- **License**: Apache License 2.0 (compatible with Apache OpenNLP)

## Contribution Protocol Options

### Option 1: Apache Contribution Process (Recommended)
This is the official way to contribute to Apache projects:

#### Step 1: Community Engagement
1. **Join the OpenNLP community**:
   - Mailing list: dev@opennlp.apache.org
   - Subscribe: dev-subscribe@opennlp.apache.org

2. **Propose the feature**:
   - Email the dev mailing list with your GPU acceleration proposal
   - Include: architecture overview, performance benefits, integration approach
   - Get community feedback and buy-in

#### Step 2: Create JIRA Issue
1. **Create feature request**: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/OPENNLP
2. **Title**: "GPU Acceleration Support for OpenNLP"
3. **Description**: Detailed proposal with:
   - Performance improvements achieved
   - Hardware compatibility
   - Integration approach
   - Backward compatibility

#### Step 3: Fork and Develop
```bash
# Fork the official Apache OpenNLP repository
git clone https://github.com/apache/opennlp.git
cd opennlp

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/gpu-acceleration

# Integrate your GPU code into the official structure
# Follow Apache OpenNLP coding standards and architecture
```

#### Step 4: Submit Pull Request
1. **Prepare submission**:
   - Clean, well-documented code
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Documentation updates
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Submit PR** to apache/opennlp repository
3. **Address review feedback** from Apache committers

### Option 2: Extension Module (Alternative)
Create an official OpenNLP extension:

#### Benefits:
- Faster integration
- Independent release cycle
- Less review overhead

#### Process:
1. **Propose extension module** to OpenNLP community
2. **Create separate repository** under Apache umbrella
3. **Maintain as official extension**

### Option 3: Third-Party Library (Current Approach)
Continue as standalone library:

#### Benefits:
- Full control over development
- Independent release schedule
- Can iterate quickly

#### Considerations:
- Less official recognition
- Users need separate dependency
- May duplicate efforts

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Community Engagement (Immediate)
1. **Email OpenNLP dev list** with proposal
2. **Present at OpenNLP community meeting** if possible
3. **Get feedback** on integration approach

### Phase 2: Technical Preparation
1. **Study OpenNLP architecture** thoroughly
2. **Align code structure** with OpenNLP patterns
3. **Prepare migration plan** from standalone to integrated

### Phase 3: Formal Contribution
1. **Submit JIRA issue** with detailed proposal
2. **Create fork** of apache/opennlp
3. **Integrate GPU features** following Apache standards
4. **Submit pull request** with comprehensive documentation

## Technical Integration Considerations

### Code Organization
```
opennlp/
├── opennlp-tools/          # Core OpenNLP
├── opennlp-gpu/           # New GPU acceleration module
│   ├── src/main/java/
│   │   └── org/apache/opennlp/gpu/
│   └── src/test/java/
└── opennlp-examples/      # Updated examples
```

### Integration Points
- **Minimal API changes**: Preserve existing OpenNLP APIs
- **Optional dependency**: GPU features don't break existing code
- **Fallback mechanism**: Automatic CPU fallback when GPU unavailable
- **Configuration**: Simple configuration for GPU enablement

### Requirements for Apache Contribution
1. **Apache License 2.0**: ✅ Already compatible
2. **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: Required
3. **Code quality**: Apache coding standards
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs and examples
5. **Tests**: High test coverage
6. **Performance benchmarks**: Quantified improvements

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase                     | Duration   | Activities                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Engagement**  | 2-4 weeks  | Mailing list discussion, proposal refinement   |
| **Technical Preparation** | 4-6 weeks  | Code restructuring, Apache standards alignment |
| **Formal Submission**     | 2-4 weeks  | JIRA creation, PR submission                   |
| **Review Process**        | 4-12 weeks | Community review, iterations                   |
| **Integration**           | 2-4 weeks  | Final integration, testing                     |

**Total Estimated Time**: 3-6 months

## Next Steps
