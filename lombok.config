# Lombok configuration

# This line ensures that if a lombok.config.local file exists, its properties are also applied.
# It's a common pattern but not strictly an 'import'. Lombok reads all lombok.config files in the path.
# For simplicity, we'll focus on standard keys. If you need to merge multiple configs,
# place them in parent directories or use a build tool feature.

# Standard configuration keys:
config.stopBubbling = true

lombok.log.fieldName = logger
lombok.extern.findbugs.addSuppressFBWarnings = true
lombok.accessors.chain = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true

# Add any other specific Lombok configurations your project needs here.
# For example, to configure the logger for a specific logging framework:
# lombok.log.slf4j.enabled = true
# lombok.log.jul.enabled = true
